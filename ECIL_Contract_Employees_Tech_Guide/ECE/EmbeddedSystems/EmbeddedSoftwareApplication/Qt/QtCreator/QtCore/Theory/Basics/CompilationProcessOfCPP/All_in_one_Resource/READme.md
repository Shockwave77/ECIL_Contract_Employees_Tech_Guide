# Lecture Notes – Usage Guide

This repository contains structured lecture notes intended to be used in conjunction with the shared Google NotebookLM workspace.

The notes are designed for active learning. Rather than reading passively, use the NotebookLM tools to restructure, validate, and reinforce your understanding.

## Recommended Learning Workflow

---

### 1. Concept Comprehension

Use the following tools to build foundational clarity:

- **Audio Overview**  
  Generate spoken summaries for rapid revision and reinforcement.

- **Video Overview**  
  Obtain visual explanations for architecture, protocols, and system flows.

- **Mind Map**  
  Visualize relationships between modules, APIs, data structures, and subsystems.

---

### 2. Structured Consolidation

Use these tools to convert raw notes into structured learning artifacts:

- **Slide Deck**  
  Transform notes into logically ordered presentation format.

- **Reports**  
  Generate detailed analytical summaries for deeper technical review.

- **Infographic**  
  Create visual summaries of workflows, layered architectures, and execution paths.

---

### 3. Reinforcement and Validation

Strengthen retention and test understanding:

- **Flashcards**  
  Memorize definitions, function prototypes, structure layouts, and key parameters.

- **Quiz**  
  Validate conceptual clarity and implementation-level understanding.

- **Data Table**  
  Organize comparisons (APIs, structures, configurations, protocol fields, etc.) in structured tabular form.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is not only documentation, but structured knowledge internalization.  
Use NotebookLM to:

- Reorganize information  
- Identify conceptual gaps  
- Validate understanding  
- Strengthen long-term retention  

Active transformation of the material leads to deeper technical mastery.
